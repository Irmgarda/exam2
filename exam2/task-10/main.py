# Inheritance with Shape Classes
# Objective: Create a base class `Shape` and two derived classes `Rectangle` and `Circle`.
# The `Shape` class should have an abstract method `area` that calculates the area of the shape.
# The derived classes should implement the `area` method.

# Details:
# - The `Shape` class should have an `__init__` method that initializes the shape with its dimensions.
# - The `Rectangle` class should be initialized with width and height.
# - The `Circle` class should be initialized with radius.
# - Both derived classes should implement the `area` method to calculate and return the area of the shape.

# Examples:
# rectangle = Rectangle(4, 5)
# circle = Circle(3)
# print(rectangle.area())  # Expected: 20
# print(circle.area())     # Expected: 28.274333882308138
